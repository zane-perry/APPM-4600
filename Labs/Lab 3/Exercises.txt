EXERCISE 1

f(x) = x^2(x-1)

a) endpoints (0.5,2):

the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08


b) endpoints (-1, 0.5):
the approximate root is -1
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = -2



c) endpoints (-1, 2):
the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08


Using the endpoints of -1 and 0.5 was not successful because both endpoints resulted in a negative
function value, which causes the bisection method to fail because it cannot guarantee that a root is in that interval by the IVT
Both of the other intervals would work. The algorithm would not be able to find x=0 as a root because it is an even root and 
does not change signs around that zero


EXERCISE 2



a) 
the approximate root is 0.9999755859374998
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -0.0001953160762948372


b)

the approximate root is 0
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = -3

c) i.

the approximate root is 0
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = 0.0

ii.

the approximate root is 0.5
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = 0.479425538604203


The algorithm used appears to be working as expected and successfully found all roots that satisfied the necessary conditions with sufficient accuracy




EXERCISE 3


a)

OverflowError: (34, 'Result too large')


b)


OverflowError: (34, 'Result too large')


c)

the approximate fixed point is: 1.475773161594552
f1(xstar): 1.4757731615945522
Error message reads: 0


d)

the approximate fixed point is: 1.473578045466708
f1(xstar): 1.4779035096682074
Error message reads: 1


The algorithm only converged for parts c and d. According to the overflow error, this indicates that the value of the function was too large when evaluated at
the values of x run by the algorithm.
