1. The newtons method is guaranteed to converge to a unique root in a close neightborhood if the following condition holds for all f(x) in the neightborhood

abs((f(x) * f''(x)) / f''(x)^2) < 1


3. In order to modify the bisection code so it stops in the basis of convergence, the bisection code also needs to take the first and second derivatives
of f(x) as inputs so that the condition above can be checked for each midpoint. A tolerance is no longer needed

5. The advantages of the new method is that it finds a point guaranteed to converge by newtons method very quickly, but you need to know the first and 
second derivative of the function in order to implement it. You also need a root of odd multiplicity for the bisection portion to still work

6. Using bisection 47 iterations were required to find the root

Using newton's method 27 iterations were required to find the root

Using the new hybrid iteration, only 9 (combined) iterations were required to find the root
